*Fingerprint Reader*

Bus 001 Device 003: ID 27c6:55b4 Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co.,Ltd. Fingerprint Reader
Lenovo Thinkpad L13 Yoga Gen 1

It seems like many of these thinkpads come with fingerprint readers that are not supported by fprint/fprintd.

This means that these thinkpads have a functional element not supported by Linux at the moment.

It seems like manufacturers either have to provide the drivers for these fingerprint readers or they have to be written.
