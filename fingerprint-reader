*Fingerprint Reader*
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 27c6:55b4 Shenzhen Goodix Technology Co.,Ltd. Fingerprint Reader
Lenovo Thinkpad L13 Yoga Gen 1

It seems like many of these thinkpads come with fingerprint readers that are not supported by fprint/fprintd.
This means that these thinkpads have a functional element not supported by Linux at the moment.
It seems like manufacturers either have to provide the drivers for these fingerprint readers or they have to be written.
Is this an accurate assesment of the issue?
