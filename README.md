# problems-solutions-further-research
Repository of notes on setting up software, steps I've taken to solve problems, crediting solutions, and marking as much information as possible relevant to the problem for future reference and reproduction.

As a linux user, I would like for more people to use linux, but I don't want to obscure the random issues that linux can have sometimes.
I'd like to investigate them and find solutions for certain issues, and better understand the "proper" way to implement things, or at least clearly understand and document why something won't work, so that I better understand the current limitations of linux and how it may differ from other operating systems.

In doing this, I hope to better learn why people prefer other operating systems, learn about workarounds for problems, and further investigate how to maintain functioning linux systems with as little compromise as possible, as well as when poking around for random, one-off issues.
